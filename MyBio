I'm a software engineer with tons of experience now looking my way into DataScience which i'm not even completely sure whether taking it or not
I think I can do better and study this course but lack confidence hopefully I can complete it
What is Data Science, Is Data Science correct for me.? Can I complete Data Science ? only folks with PhD need data science
Am I qualified to get into DataScience
no worries we will see how this checks out for the next one week
WOW..! tons of questions and lot of doubts.
I've 6 months to complete the course but at the sametime I need to think what I will do with my current job like what happens if I get fired before i complete the course
I need to look for alternatives either way.
Financially it's tought to continue this course but I've to do something to survive with my current job
I've no clue what can be done
we can always try what happens
